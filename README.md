# Image_Compression_HuffmanCoding
This project explores techniques and algorithms for compressing images effectively. It aims to reduce image size while preserving as much quality as possible, leveraging methods such as:

Lossy Compression (e.g., JPEG)

Lossless Compression (e.g., PNG, Huffman Coding)

Transform Coding (DCT, Wavelet)

Run Length Encoding (RLE)

Entropy-based models
